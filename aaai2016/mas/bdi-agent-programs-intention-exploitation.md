Robust Execution of BDI Agent Programs by Exploiting Synergies Between Intentions (Yao et al)

Belief-Desire-Intetnion (BDI) Based Agent:
    * Represented by Beliefs, plans and goals (pomdp with macro actions?)
    * Intention progression -> Seems like a policy tree in a POMDP?

Seems to be applied to software agents? Round robin+? Schedulers

Synerrgy: the execution of an action for one intention, backups pre-condition failure?

Confused...
