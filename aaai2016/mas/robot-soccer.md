Offensive motivation problem coordination

Selectiely reactive coordination (divide planning into two layers):
    * Coordinate opponenet agnostic layer
    * Reactive plan to inidivdual opponents

Zone-Based Plan Skeleton:
    * Each defender assigned to a zone
    * Switch depending on opponent
    * Zones evolve through time (use some search scheme to find new zones)
    * New zones: which zones minimize the cost?
    * Trying to estimate P(goal|a,x)
    * Build a probability function for above for each action?
