Analyze error bounds associated with nn depth for fully connected or cnn netowrks -> not resnets

Contributions:
    * Uniform Rademacher bound dnn and cdd
    * Betti bound

For DNN and CNN capacity increases with depth given the Radmacher bound

Larger Betti numer -> better classification power 

Betti number: increasing depth -> increasing Betti number -> increasing classification power?

Both bound increases lead to more classificaiton power (deeper is better...)
