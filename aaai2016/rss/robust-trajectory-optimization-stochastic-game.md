Robust Trajecotry Optimization

Classical methods are not robust to disturbances:
    * Can use robust control to deal with noise (solve min-max problem with HJI pde) - not scalable

Cooperative game theoretic approach to control:
    * Multiple controllers
    * Each controller is a player - trying to minimize a joint cost
    * Simplify to decopuled systems of linear equations - not sure how

Experiments:
    * Two pole cart + joints

Extends:
    * Multi-agent control + human robot collaboration

Applied to reinforcement learning (two pole cart)
