Peter Norvig: 

Students today:
* Students don't want to read full chapters - want quick summaries
* Dn't want to implement algorithms (can just clone from github)
* Students don't need to understand whole thing, jst enough to get going
* More gentle introduction for students with limited technical background
* AI: mathematic field -> software engineering field (dont need to understand, just want to use)
